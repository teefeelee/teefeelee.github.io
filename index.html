					<h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Welcome to Tilee's home page. <br>My name is Tiffany Lee but you can always call me Tiff.
					<br>I am a self-taught web developer and programmer. About 3 months ago I was still a Research Analyst at a financial service firm, now I am here building my own personal portoflio.<br>
						I am currently completing my double degree in Business and IT at UTS. You may think that since I am doing IT, I cannot be a self-taught programmer. That is true. However, I was sel-teaching myself to code up to March this year when I started my first semester of IT. <br>
						I was working full time, studying part time to complete my Business degree. I was working 3 jobs at the time.
						My passion for programming started when I was working full time as a Research Analyst at a financial service firm in the city. I did this during my 1 hour lunch break each day. I started learning C language on my own to get a foundation of programming. <br>  It was honestly challenging at the beginning where I did not know where to start or what to look for, There were lots of Google searches, and the more I Googled, the more I had to learn. It was so overwhelming. I thought of giving up a few times.
						Once I understand the fundamental of the language, I started learning Java, C++, JavaScript, PHP and SQL, though I am still struggling to understand for loop.
						I decided to format my laptop and install Linux on my laptop <br>
						I quit my job in March this year to pursue my career in programming.<br>
						I've learned how to Google the right question, become familarised with StackOverflow and Github.
						Fun fact, StackOver
						From the other side, I've seen a lot of self-taught programmers who can write a specific bit of code but can't work at a higher level to design a system.
