          <p class="med">I was born and raised in Vietnam by grandma as my mother passed away when I was 3 and my father wasn't around. I never thought I would be interested in computers, given that I grew up in poverty and never had a chance to experience technology growing up.
          My experience with computers started when I first played Assassin's Creed 2 on my boyfriend's computer back in 2015. I took a liking to the game and until this day, it remains one of my favourate games. 
            <br>
          
            But my interest for computers didn't start until my boyfriend introduced me to the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I needed a computer to play with him at home, so he taught me to build my first computer in 2017. 
            <br>
            <br>
            And since then, my life has been evolved around computers.</p>
